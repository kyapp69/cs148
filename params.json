  "body": "# Problem Statement\r\nIn this project, I set out to recreate the graphical effect made famous by the 2007 video game Portal, by Valve Corporation. In that game, the player is able to create two portals, one blue and one orange, and these portals are \"linked.\" So, when a player looks through the blue portal, it is as if they are looking through it and out of the orange portal, and vice versa. The screenshot below shows the effect in action, and shows one interesting aspect of the effect - portals can be seen through recursively.\r\n\r\n![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/_pl13HiabQubl8GBOEAHADXf_rtthnvYNnjcE64wtOs2p8B1D52sLc7LCIBEwxws8WE7_kdxYoHQAYBRDpAdLJXKkUYf7LSg0dOVsGCd_Boc-Br7mQqxI0E5gb6nWRywsA7gnFhzE5ImCdCQDraksX40A3sUyDjQutnleLB_OLxeR9xVIypIK4lFDg2jgzGS6oyj7dwxufCBZL7z_fgI7uhO_5U63EEacZU8hDlewbOGfnkSga2k8HD92wZFB5CJnHYMO3eZuznT6xhdsAlE1HxnG1c9JtLLDv9uMpAte8Dp2m3rWkMcoJbjdgkT-OnaOR9Riw8o2iuF91llwKuQguMVE1dMpi_ZaAZFBQ7FfSWFqNoBH7dT_utSjhwGHEH2fZyu5tYMC-t-hN07tNB2iRzzUVQkKubICDwS9a_ddvToQkPJdMJrDq-k8NxnEPfRB-qbAl1KIiy1uBJNtA7bGvrYoRG6F_UqBGAe6U_U8pGJMEjArGnuzvDD0_1e5S_DlByTgSQ6W60pwnJ8dEZzCYYlPy3wpgIJOlE4BWcQKYj4gKGzJJKJlyFrmBlAuS5mNZHnL089Uv7GOxLXp919JTxk3NaY3aQ=w933-h525-no)\r\n\r\n",
